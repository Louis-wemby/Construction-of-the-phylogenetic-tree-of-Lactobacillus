# Construction-of-the-phylogenetic-tree-of-Lactobacillus
NOTICE: This project is still under development. We will update latest results at intervals.

WHO ARE WE?
  
  Our team is composed of four undergraduates from Institute of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. All our members share a background in bioinformatics. Meanwhile, we are engaging in "China Undergraduate Life Sciences Contest (Scientific Exploration) 2025".

WHAT'S THE AIM?
  
  Here, we make an attempt to construct the phylogenetic tree of selected Lactobacillus species, followed by functional analyses of genes related to fermented products. Our final aim is to help design strains with hyper fermentation efficiency.

WHAT'S NEW IN OUR PROJECT?
  
  Different from conventional classification criterion of Lactobacillus and relevant species (particularly Kefir strains), we try to make a breakthrough that the strains of interest can be screened by their final metabolic products, which are usually utilized to manufacture fermented foodstuffs such as yogurt, pickles, etc. By this means, we believe that it is plausible to figure out the genetic relationship between these strains so as to analyze gene functions that might reveal ultra-efficiency in fermentation.
